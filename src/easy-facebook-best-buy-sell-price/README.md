# Description

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by **Facebook**.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given `[9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10]`, you should return `5`, since you could buy the stock at `5` dollars and sell it at `10` dollars.
