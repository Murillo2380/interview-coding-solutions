# Description

Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by **Facebook**:

Given a sequence of numbers, find the longest sequence that contains only 2 unique numbers.

Example:
Input: `[1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 3, 1, 5]`
Output: `4`
The longest sequence that contains just 2 unique numbers is `[3, 1, 3, 1]`

Here's the solution signature:

```py
def findSequence(seq):
  # Fill this in.

print findSequence([1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 3, 1, 5])
  # 4
```
