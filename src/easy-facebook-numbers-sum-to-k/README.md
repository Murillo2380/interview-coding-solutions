# Description

Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by **Facebook**:

You are given a list of numbers, and a target number k. Return whether or not there are two numbers in the list that add up to k.

Example:
Given `[4, 7, 1 , -3, 2]` and `k = 5`,
return true since `4 + 1 = 5`.

Try to do it in a single pass of the list.
