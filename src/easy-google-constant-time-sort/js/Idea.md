# Idea behind the solution

You just need to apply the [Bucket sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort) to sort any array of numbers in linear time. Since we know there will be only 1, 2 and 3, we will use a constant memory space just to count how many of each we found and then modify the array to be sorted.
