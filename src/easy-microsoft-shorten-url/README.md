# Description

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by **Microsoft**.

Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:

`shorten(url)`, which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as `zLg6wl`.
`restore(short)`, which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return null.
Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?
