# Description

Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by **Twitter**:

You are given an array of integers. Find the maximum sum of all possible contiguous subarrays of the array.

Example:

```
[34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86]
```

Given this input array, the output should be `137`. The contiguous subarray with the largest sum is `[42, 14, -5, 86]`.

Your solution should run in linear time.

Here's a starting point:

```py
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    # Fill this in.

print max_subarray_sum([34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86])
# 137
```
