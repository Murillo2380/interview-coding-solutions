# Description

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by **Facebook**.

Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` rotated by two becomes `[3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]`. Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?
