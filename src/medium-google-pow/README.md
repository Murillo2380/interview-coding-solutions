# Description

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by **Google**.

Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the `pow(x, y)` function, where `x` and `y` are integers and returns `x^y`.

Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication.

For example, `pow(2, 10)` should return `1024`.
