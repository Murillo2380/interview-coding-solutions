# Idea behind the solution

This problem has already been solved by [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_coin#Fair_results_from_a_biased_coin). In any unbiased coin, the probability of getting a **head** and than a **tail** must be the same as getting a **tail** and then a **head**. Therefore, flips 2 biased coins, if they are different then just return the first coin, otherwise, repeat. With this login, the result cannot be biased.
